Enterprise Resource Planning – Preferhub Solutions Home About Services AI & Machine Learning CRM Data Analytics & BI Enterprise Resource Planning Governance, Risk & Compliance IT Managed Services & Consulting Product Development Integration Services Blog Contact Us Menu Close Enterprise Resource Planning Growing companies eventually reach a point where spreadsheets no longer cut it. That’s where enterprise resource planning software comes in: ERP systems collect and organize key business information and help organizations run lean, efficient operations, even as they expand. Most business professionals have heard the term “ERP,” but they may not know exactly what enterprise resource planning systems can do for their teams. We’ll explain exactly what ERP is, how it works, what it can do for your business, how to choose the right solution and much more. Why Is ERP Important for Businesses? ERP systems have become table stakes for businesses looking to use resources wisely. They can help leaders reallocate human and financial capital or build more efficient core business processes that save money without sacrificing on quality or performance. An ERP is also an asset when it comes to planning and coordination. Employees can see current available inventory and customer orders in detail, then compare supplier purchase orders and forecasted future demand. If necessary, they can make adjustments to head off problems. ERP software improves communication and collaboration as well because workers can check on the status of other departments to guide their own decisions. As a comprehensive source of data, an ERP system also provides a host of reports and analytics that can be difference-makers for the business. Turning a vast trove of information into charts and graphs that clearly illustrate trends and help model possible results is an ERP capability executives find invaluable.

Integration Services – Preferhub Solutions Home About Services AI & Machine Learning CRM Data Analytics & BI Enterprise Resource Planning Governance, Risk & Compliance IT Managed Services & Consulting Product Development Integration Services Blog Contact Us Menu Close Integration Services Depending on whom you ask, you might get different answers to that question ranging from descriptions such as a data import/export wizard, to an ETL tool, to a control flow engine, to an application platform, or to a high-performance data transformation pipeline. All are correct because Integration Services is a set of utilities, applications, designers, components, and services all wrapped up into one powerful software application suite. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) is many things to many people. ETL Tool ETL is an acronym for Extract, Transform, and Load and describes the processes that take place in data warehousing environments for extracting data from source transaction systems; transforming, cleaning, deduplicating, and conforming the data; and finally loading it into cubes or other analysis destinations. Although Data Transformation Services (DTS), Integration Services’ predecessor application, was considered a valuable tool for doing ETL, Integration Services is where true Enterprise ETL became available in SQL Server. Control Flow Engine The processes involved in moving data from location to location and transforming it along the way are not restricted to only processing data. Integration Services provides a control flow for performing work that is tangentially related to the actual processing that happens in data flow, including downloading and renaming files, dropping and creating tables, rebuilding indexes, performing backups, and any other number of tasks. Integration Services provides a full-featured control flow to support such activities. Application Platform Developers can create applications that use Integration Services as a platform, embedding the engines within their application using the provided object models. As a developer, you can embed the Integration Services engines and components within your applications using the object models. High Performance Data Transformation Data Pipeline That’s a mouthful and really incorporates two ideas: high performance and data pipelining. The Data Flow Task is a high-performance tool because you can use it to perform complex data transformations on very large datasets for incredibly performant processing. The pipeline concept means that you can process data from multiple heterogeneous data sources, through multiple parallel sequential transformations, into multiple heterogeneous data destinations, making it possible to process data found in differing formats and on differing media in one common “sandbox” location.

PRESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS – Preferhub Solutions Home About Services AI & Machine Learning CRM Data Analytics & BI Enterprise Resource Planning Governance, Risk & Compliance IT Managed Services & Consulting Product Development Integration Services Blog Contact Us Menu Close PRESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS Home > General > PRESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS Post author: Sakthi Post published: February 11, 2020 Post category: General Definition Prescriptive Analytics is the data analytics area which focuses on finding the best course of action in a scenario given the data available. Specifically, prescriptive analytics factors information about possible situations or scenarios,available resources, past performance, and current performance, and suggests a course of action or strategy. Its aim is to find the best solution given a variety of choices. Analytics, which use optimization and simulation algorithms to advise on possible outcomes and answer: “What should we do?” What performs prescriptive analytics? Prescriptive analytics relies on optimization and rule – based techniques for decision making. Optimizing strategies such as linear programming, integer programming, and nonlinear programming play an important role in prescriptive analytics, as they allow for optimized decision making. These techniques are applied to a model that represents the decisions to be made, the decision constraints and an objective to compare the decisions. Throughout prescriptive analytics, rules-based strategies like inference engines, scorecards, and decision trees are used to make a decision such as deciding to shut down repair equipment when sensor readings reach thresholds, or approving a financial transaction when its score is large enough. Example Prescriptive analytics could be used to assess whether residents should be required by a local fire department to evacuate a particular area when a wildfire is burning nearby. Uses Making real-time data-driven business Solve issues that may be impeding growth Creating a highly customized user experience Expense reduction Key Points Prescriptive analytics deals through predictive analytics, utilizing data to determine short-term performance. Using prescriptive analytics effectively can help organizations make decisions based on facts and probability-weighted projections, rather than jumping to instinct-based, under-informed conclusions. Prescriptive analytics utilizes machine learning to help companies determine a course of action based on the forecasts of a computer program. Pros It can tell the organization how to overcome future challenges. It also helps to avoid any untoward incident in the future in terms of non achievement of targets, shortages of resources, or reduction in cash flows.

They are the analytics that describe the past. They are very useful because it allows us to learn from past behaviors and understand how they might influence future outcomes.Analytics, which use data aggregation and data mining to provide insight into the past and answer: “What has happened?” What performs descriptive analytics? Data aggregation and Data mining are the two approaches which are used to discover historical data. Data is first obtained and processed by data aggregation to help analysts handle the datasets more effectively. The next step of analysis is described by data mining which involves the search of data to identify patterns and establish relationships to solve problems. Data mining tools allow enterprises to predict future trends. Functions State business metrics Determine which metrics are important for the measurement of results against business objectives. Identify data required It is used to identify the business data located in different sources within the enterprise, including systems of record, databases and desktops. Extract and prepare data For analysis, data must be prepared. Transformation, Duplication and cleansing are the some of the examples of data preparation that takes place prior to analysis. Analyze data Data analyst can run analyses such as summary statistics and regression analysis on the data to identify patterns and measure performance. Present data The analytics results are usually presented to stakeholders in the form of charts or graphs, where the data visualization mentioned earlier comes into play. Uses of descriptive analytics To review past events, such as regional sales, consumer retention, or marketing campaign success. Tabulation of social metrics such as Facebook likes, Tweets, or followers. Comparing pre-test and post-test assessments. General trends such as hot travel destinations or news patterns are identified. Key Points Descriptive analytics is the process of analyzing historical data to better understand the changes that have taken place in an organization. Using a variety of historical data and bench marking, decision-makers get a holistic view of results and patterns to focus their business strategy on. Descriptive analytics can help identify a organization’s areas of strength and weakness. Pros Identify gaps and performance issues early-before they develop into problems. Analyze the value and impact of the resources on course design and learning. Quickly and easily report on the Return on Investment (ROI) by showing how performance achieved business or target goals. “Use Descriptive Analytics when you need to understand at an aggregate level what is going on in your company, and when you want to summarize and describe different aspects of your business…” You Might Also Like Data Analytics October 1, 2019 Extract Data Using X-path Query in Talend October 20, 2019 Utility Analytics October 5, 2019 PREFERHUB.COM info@preferhub.com (346) 298-0208 IMPORTANT LINKS About Contact Services Privacy Policy SOCIAL MEDIA Twitter Facebook-f Linkedin Address: 200, Union Blvd., Suite 200, Lakewood, Colorado-80228, United States of America.

Unlike traditional systems, Hadoop enables multiple types of analytic workloads to run on the same data at same time, at massive scale on industry standard hardware. It’s at the center of an ecosystem of big data technologies that are primarily used to support advanced analytics initiatives, including predictive analytics , data mining and machine learning . THE CORE COMPONENTS OF
HADOOP HADOOP HDFS HDFS is the H adoop D istributed F ile S ystem. It makes it possible to store and replicate data across multiple servers to prevent the loss of data. The data is split into multiple blocks; each of these blocks has a default size of 128MB. Unlike other distributed systems, HDFS is highly fault tolerant and designed using low-cost hardware.

The data is split into multiple blocks; each of these blocks has a default size of 128MB. Unlike other distributed systems, HDFS is highly fault tolerant and designed using low-cost hardware. HDFS follows the master-slave data architecture In Mapping,
data in each split is passed to a mapping function to produce output
values. In Shuffling, consumes the output of mapping phase. Its task is to
consolidate the relevant records from Mapping phase output. In Reducing, output
values from the Shuffling phase are aggregated. This phase combines values from
Shuffling phase and returns a single output value. In short, this phase
summarizes the complete dataset. Reduce task should begin after the completion
of the map task. HADOOP YARN YARN stands for Y et A nother R esource N avigator and
is the resource management and job scheduling technology in the open
source Hadoop distributed processing framework. YARN is responsible
for allocating system resources to the various applications running in a Hadoop cluster and scheduling tasks to be executed on different
cluster nodes. YARN consists of: Resource Manager – It is the master daemon of YARN and is responsible for resource assignment and management among all the applications. Whenever it receives a processing request, it forwards it to the corresponding node manager and allocates resources for the completion of the request accordingly.It has two major components : 1. Scheduler   2.Application Manager Node Manager: It takes care of individual node on Hadoop cluster and manages application and workflow and that particular node. Its primary job is to keep-up with the Node Manager. It is also responsible for creating the container process and starts it on the request of Application master. Application Master: An application is a single job submitted to a framework. The application manager is responsible for negotiating resources with the resource manager, tracking the status and monitoring progress of a single application. The application master requests the container from the node manager by sending a Container Launch Context (CLC) which includes everything an application needs to run. Once the application is started, it sends the health report to t he resource manager from time-to-time. HADOOP
